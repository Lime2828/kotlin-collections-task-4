Well... Even with your awesome error-checking in the monkey cage system, it seems that the zookeepers still can't manage the monkeys properly... 

Monkeys are ending up in the wrong cages, some are squashed three-to-a-cage. It's just a mess!

We need you to **automate** the cage system so that the zookeepers don't have to make decisions.
